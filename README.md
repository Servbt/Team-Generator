# Generating a Team

## Plans Towards Completion

At this very moment there are alot of improvements that I need to work on for this project:

* I need to grab the values generated from inquirer and throw them in their respective templates for each class
* I need to actually make Inquirer prompts for generating respective classes, such as interns, engineers, and students
* Styling needs to be worked on for the generated html file
* I need to make sure that the tests are written properly and make sure they pass
* I need to make a video showing the functionality of the project
